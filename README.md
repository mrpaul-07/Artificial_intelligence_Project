## Topic: Predicting Student Depression Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

This Project focuses on predicting the likelihood of depression among students by applying different algorithms **"Machine Learning Algorithms"** & **"Deep Learning Algorithms"**.

Essentially, I applied linear regression, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network models to analyze the student data and predict the signs of depression.
